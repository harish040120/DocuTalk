# DocuTalk: Document-Based Conversational Assistant

DocuTalk is a conversational assistant designed to interact with users based on the content of uploaded PDF documents. This Python application allows users to upload PDF files, and then query the system with natural language questions. DocuTalk processes the uploaded documents, extracts relevant information, and responds to user queries with the extracted content.

## Features

- **Document Processing**: DocuTalk can handle multiple PDF files uploaded by the user. It extracts text content from each PDF document and prepares it for further analysis.
  
- **Conversational Interface**: Users can interact with DocuTalk using natural language queries. The system uses advanced natural language processing techniques to understand user questions and provide relevant responses.

- **Document Retrieval**: DocuTalk utilizes a document retrieval system to find relevant information from the uploaded documents based on user queries. It employs vector embeddings and memory-based techniques to retrieve contextually appropriate responses.
